# About me

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about statistics and computer science. And I am specially enthusiastic about data science, machine learning and computational finance.
- ðŸ‘¯ I would love to dive into the scientific study of the above areas.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can view the linkedin account in my profile, send me email: nanwaigyz@163.com or add my wechat: 1299680751. I would be happy to meet new friends.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: The best word to describe me may be versatile: especially in sports. I have been working on running with various distances, road cycling, volleyball, badminton etc.<br>
BTW, if you are also interested in cycling, you can add my Zwift accoutï¼šERIC CIRE[ZCRC]
- âš¡ Fun fact: Somehow, I love to use "EriccirE" as my username. At first, to avoid the duplication of name in some game accounts, I use the trick of anagram.<br>
But then I found it is quite distinguishable. And the latter part, cire, is a real word. So I decided to use it afterwards.<br>
In fact, if you see an account named as EriccirE, sometimes with a suffix gyz, it's highly possible to be me.ðŸ˜„
